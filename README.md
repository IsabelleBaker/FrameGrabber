# FrameGrabber
Simple python UI to grab frames from a video

  -Allows for stepping forward, backward, and scrubbing through the video. 
  
  -Provides ability to resize frames upon saving. Note that resizing also makes the frames square by adding a black padding as a border. The border will look similar to what is shown in the UI around the frame as you resize the window.  
  
  -Provides the ability to associate a track pkl file generated by my dynamic background removal app. This would allow a user to train a model, test it, then use the output of the test to quickly identify and export new video frames that the model struggled to handle. Those frames can be annoted and the model retrained. This process loop would allow for rapid refinement of a model. I'll probably make a video explaining this process.
